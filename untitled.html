    <h1>Fifa</h1>
    <p>Starting off with FIFA. FIfa is the best football game that is out even though some poeple might not agree it outsells all the other football games. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_(video_game_series)#:~:text=By%202000%2C%20the%20FIFA%20series,most%20profitable%20EA%20Sports%20title."> (to see more credability) </a> I would rank the whole seris a 9/10 personnaly this is the most game I play. This game has many viraties you can play with 8 friends when you are all together and you can also play diffrent gamemodes like career mode volta which is new and many more things along with them is ultimate team the most played game mode in fifa which is what makes or breaks the game over the years you can feel that the gamemode is just a cash grab for the game but even though it makes me rage a lot its a very good gamemode and I always come back to it. </p>
